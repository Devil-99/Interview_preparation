### **API - Application Programming Interface** :

➡️ An API is like a waiter in a restaurant who takes your order and gives it to the kitchen. When you ask the waiter for food, they go to the kitchen, get your food, and bring it back to you.

    API is a way for different software applications to communicate with each other. An API defines how an app can ask for information or services from server, and how it should receive the response.

    An API acts like a middleman between the app and the server. When an app sends a request to an API, the API takes that request, processes it, and sends back a response.

    APIs can be used for a variety of things, like retrieving data from a server, sending data to a server etc.

### **REST - REpresentational State Transfer** :

➡️ A REST API is like a special kind of waiter that serves food in a certain way. The food is called data, and the way it's served is called a format.  
This special kind of waiter can serve the food in a way that's easy for your app to understand and use. It's like getting your food on a plate with a fork and knife that you know how to use.

    A REST API is a type of API that uses a specific set of rules for sending and receiving data. These rules are called the RESTful architecture.

    A REST API has several characteristics that make it unique.
    -> It's stateless, meaning that each request is independent of the previous request.
    -> It's cacheable, meaning that the app can store the response for later use.
    -> It's also uniform, meaning that the same rules apply to all resources.

A RESTful API is an architectural style for an API that uses HTTP requests to access and use data.  
REST architecture gives you a method to work on CRUD operation on a sigle api url with multiple HTTP methods like GET,POST,UPDATE,DELETE.
