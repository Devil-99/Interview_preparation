1. ### Why Consultant role not SDE ?
    So as a freshers I have no boundation like I only want to work on product base or service base companies or like as a SDE or System Engineer. As a fresher, I look forward to learn new skills and technologies, working cultures of tech companies and gain experience. I just want to be a part of this growing culture of companys.. So any field will be comfortable at my learning phase.. It will add a good experience in me.

2. ### WHY Deloitte ?
    I always wanted to see myself in a tech giant and Deloitte is one of top Accounting and cosultency firm.
    I came to know form my seniors who are in Deloitte that has a great working culture and is very supporting in career and personal growth. So I believe Deloitte can provide me the platform to fulfill my goals.

3. ### Where do you see yourself in 5 years?
    As a software engineer learning new technologies is a passion for me.. and just like everyone I want to see myself in tech giants and big MNCs. So if I got a chance to work with your company I will improve myself day by day and will try to reach at a top level position.

4. ### How do you handle pressure situation ?
    I will prioritise my tasks as which will be needed soon and which can be done slowly and make a proper schedule. Then I will try to do those higher priority complex tasks as soon as possible. If I see it much difficult I will ask for help to my seniors, colleagues.. if that is done then will look on the low priority task and the easy ones..
