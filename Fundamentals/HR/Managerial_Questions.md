1. ### Why Consultant role not SDE ?
    So as a freshers I have no boundation like I only want to work on product base or service base companies or like as a SDE or System Engineer. As a fresher, I look forward to learn new skills and technologies, working cultures of tech companies and gain experience. I just want to be a part of this growing culture of companys.. So any field will be comfortable at my learning phase.. It will add a good experience in me.

2. ### WHY Deloitte ?
    I always wanted to see myself in a tech giant and Deloitte is one of top Accounting and cosultency firm.
    I came to know form my seniors who are in Deloitte that has a great working culture and is very supporting in career and personal growth. So I believe Deloitte can provide me the platform to fulfill my goals.

3. ### Where do you see yourself in 5 years?
    As a software engineer learning new technologies is a passion for me.. and just like everyone I want to see myself in tech giants and big MNCs. So if I got a chance to work with your company I will improve myself day by day and will try to reach at a top level position.

4. ### How do you handle pressure situation ?
    I will prioritise my tasks as which will be needed soon and which can be done slowly and make a proper schedule. Then I will try to do those higher priority complex tasks as soon as possible. If I see it much difficult I will ask for help to my seniors, colleagues.. if that is done then will look on the low priority task and the easy ones..

5. ### Why you didn't get Amazon PPO ?
    During my internship I was firstly given a rampup task to understand the codebase, tech stack and be comfortable with the environment and after completion I was given my 1st project. And it took me a bit more time than expected because of the complexity. But at my last month of internship my Manager told our team that the project structure was changed a bit, so some of our work has to be change. I tried hard but couldn't complete some of the task. And in Amazon they give most importance on Project completion so I guess that's why I didn't get the ppo along with my some other friends. Though I got a good feedback from my manager and mentor.

6. ### Experience in Amazon.
    My 6 months amazon experience was a mix of good and bad. I learned a lot of things like team work, time management, work culture. I learned about Amazon's internal services, a lot of technologies they used like AWS, their internal code base. What I mostly remember was my relation with other team members, my manager, mentor, peer. They are very much helpful and give at home feel. Because of them, my fear of speaking has gone.    
    There was another intern in our team and she was working on some other task. My rampup task was done before her so I helped her to solve her doubts and got accolade.   
    Also another thing I have really learn is advance searching. Like how to debug an error, how to get help from google in an optimised way.   
    I took notes of everyday about my tasks to be done, things to learn, and what already have learnt.  
    And in a timely manner, I schedule a meeting with my mentor and manager to take feedback about my work and know about the goals on a bigger perspective and also strengthen my weakness.
    So ,though I didn't get the PPO, but came back with a lot of experience and learnings.

7. ### What you have done in this year?
    After my passout from college, I totally dedicated my time to learn new things and to be prepare for any job interview. I started preparation of DSA, CS Fundamentals etc and gave a few interview but unfortunately or fortunately didn't get any offer though I cleared all the rounds for some cases. Besides that I learn webD, made a few projects like FunTalk, loca-weather etc. 
        
    Besides that, I love to travel so I travel some places like Mumbai and Bangalore just to explore new culture and gather experience and to spend some time except from the monotonous life.

8. ### What if you don't get Deloitte to ?
    As I said I was trying for multiple companies for this past one year. Unfortunately or fortunately I don't know, but I didn't get any opportunity. But yes even if I don't get Deloitte this time, I'll still be continuing my preparation. Because if I keep pushing myself maybe not today but one day I'll definitely be able to crack.
