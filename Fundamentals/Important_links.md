### **Q.** We have a website, and it is slowing down? What could be the possible reason for that? How can you troubleshoot this problem?
- **Poor Server Performance** - May be because of the cheaper host or for other cause, the server is taking longer to respond.
- **Heavy Traffic** - May be the traffic at that time is way more than its capacity.
- **Increased HTTP request** - If a website contains too much JavaScript, CSS, and too many image files, it will lead to increased HTTP requests. In this case, whenever someone visits the website, the browser pings the server with far too many requests to load many files.Hence got slow.
- **Lack of a CDN** - CDN allocates local server to a website. This minimizes the page load time , hence got slow down.
- **Inadequate Caching Techniques**
- **Code Density**
