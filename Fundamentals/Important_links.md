[Abstraction vs Encapsulation](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/742341/difference-between-abstraction-and-encapsulation)

[Solid Principle in OOPs](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/solid-principle-in-programming-understand-with-real-life-examples/) - 

1. **Single Responsibility Principle :-** This means a class should have only one responsibility. It should serve only one purpose.
2. **Open-Closed Principle :-** It states "Software Components (such as classes, modules, function, etc) should be open for extension but close for modifications."     
It means new functionality in the code can be added without changing the exsisting code.
3. **Liskov's Substitution Principle :-** According to this "Derived or child classes must be substitutable for their base or parent classes". In simple terms, a farmer's son should inherit farming skill from his father and should be able to replace his father if needed.
4. **Interface Segregation Principle :-** It states that “do not force any client to implement an interface which is irrelevant to them“.
5. **Dependency Inversion Principle :-** 
    - High-level modules/classes should not depend on low-level modules/classes. Both should depend upon abstractions.
    - Abstractions should not depend upon details. Details should depend upon abstractions.

[Authentication vs Authorization](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-authentication-and-authorization/)

- **Authentication** - Who are you ? Are you an authenticated user ?
- **Authorization** - If you are an authenticated user, What permissions do you have ? *(There are Admin, FrontEnd user, Backend user etc. with different permission/ Authorization, but they are all authenticated.)*

### **Q.** We have a website, and it is slowing down? What could be the possible reason for that? How can you troubleshoot this problem?
- **Poor Server Performance** - May be because of the cheaper host or for other cause, the server is taking longer to respond.
- **Heavy Traffic** - May be the traffic at that time is way more than its capacity.
- **Increased HTTP request** - If a website contains too much JavaScript, CSS, and too many image files, it will lead to increased HTTP requests. In this case, whenever someone visits the website, the browser pings the server with far too many requests to load many files.Hence got slow.
- **Lack of a CDN** - CDN allocates local server to a website. This minimizes the page load time , hence got slow down.
- **Inadequate Caching Techniques**
- **Code Density**
